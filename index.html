        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate 16-year-old Python developer currently enrolled in an IT school. Specializing in making Discord bots, I find joy in bringing my imaginative ideas to life through code. Whether it's creating entertaining applications or building tools with practical utility, I thrive on the endless possibilities that programming offers. I have a particular fondness for the simplicity of command-line interfaces, appreciating the elegance in their straightforward design.</p>
